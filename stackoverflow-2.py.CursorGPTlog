/home/daniella/Desktop/kiri/stackoverflow.py:3: PyGIWarning: Gtk was imported without specifying a version first. Use gi.require_version('Gtk', '4.0') before import to ensure that the right version gets loaded.
  from gi.repository import Gtk
Icon name (case sensitive): distributor-logo
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/daniella/Desktop/kiri/stackoverflow.py", line 7, in <module>
    theme = Gtk.IconTheme.get_default()
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: type object 'IconTheme' has no attribute 'get_default'




The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the Gtk.IconTheme.get_default() method is not available in Gtk 4.0. This method was available in Gtk 3.0, but it has been removed in Gtk 4.0.

To fix this issue, you need to specify the version of Gtk before importing it. You can do this by using the gi.require_version() function. Here's how you can modify your code:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import gi
gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')
from gi.repository import Gtk

# Rest of your code

This will ensure that Gtk 3.0 is used when running your script, which should resolve the AttributeError you're seeing.
